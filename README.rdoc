= Dopewars v.1.0.0

This is a Ruby port of the original dopewars/drugwars game.

== Overview

You are a drug dealer. Your goal is to buy and sell drugs and make money without being caught.
You have 30 days to fly around the world making your purchases and selling your product.

This is a single player game. As the player, your goal is to beat your previous score.
Your score is the total amount you're worth at the end of the game.
You lose only if you get caught, or if you owe any money at the end of the game.

Simple economy. Drug value is, to some degree, determined randomly by the day.

== How to play
For linux/mac

For windows
